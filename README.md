# llm-learning

Few years ago, I took [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), now most of the knowledge is already gone. I want to revise it and start learning about [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model).
